# Phase 1 Fixtures — Expected Outcomes

Each fixture is a minimal app directory (`app.xml`, plus `components/` when a
composite is involved). These expected outcomes are what `test/loader.test.js`
asserts and what manual runs of `tools/load.js` should show.

Phase 1 scope notes (per the design doc's RESOLVED entries):

* A `type` that resolves to `components/<type>.xml` is a composite and is
  expanded (fresh instance per mount). Any other type is a leaf node — no
  primitives, manifests, or field-existence validation exist in Phase 1.
* The local scope of a bare-name reference is the innermost enclosing
  composite instance (or the app root); its local fields are the parameters
  bound at that instance's mount site (or the `<app>` element's attributes at
  app scope).
* Every unresolved or ambiguous reference is a load-time error whose message
  names the reference site (file, line, and the reference text).

## double-mount/ — must load successfully

One composite (`contact-card`) mounted twice inside `directory`. Proves
definition-scoped resolution and exercises four reference forms:

| Reference site (in contact-card)  | entryOne instance binds to              | entryTwo instance binds to              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `{phoneField.value}` (named)      | `app.directory.entryOne.card.phoneField` | `app.directory.entryTwo.card.phoneField` |
| `{label}` (local, mount param)    | `entryOne` param `label` ("Alice")       | `entryTwo` param `label` ("Bob")         |
| `{^directory.heading}` (upward)   | `app.directory`                          | `app.directory`                          |

Plus `{app.title}` (absolute) in `app.xml` → the `<app>` element's `title`.

The decisive check: the two `{phoneField.value}` sites bind to **distinct**
target paths — each instance's internal reference finds its *own* inner
component, never the other instance's.

## fail-bare-name/ — must fail at load

`{search}` is a bare name; its scope is the app root, and `<app>` declares no
`search`. Bare names do not search outward. Error must name the site:
`app.xml`, the line of `Search: {search}`, and the reference `{search}`.

## fail-ambiguous/ — must fail at load

`contact-card` is mounted twice, so `phoneField` exists at two paths. The
composite's *internal* `{phoneField.value}` is legal (definition scope), but
the *app-level* reference `Selected phone: {phoneField.value}` in `app.xml`
is ambiguous app-wide. Error must name the app.xml site and should list the
candidate paths.

## fail-no-ancestor/ — must fail at load

`needs-workspace` references `{^workspace.budget}` but is mounted with no
ancestor named `workspace` anywhere above it. Error must name the site in
`components/needs-workspace.xml` and the missing ancestor name.

## fail-app-reserved/ — must fail at load

A component instance is named `app`, which is reserved for the root so that
`{app...}` always means "from the root." Error must name the offending
element and its location.
